        <div>When you use Duck services, you trust us with your information. This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what data we collect, why we collect it, and what we do with it.

        <div class="text title">Privacy Policy</div>

        <!--<div>The mission of "VALLEX" - We create software, implement up-to-date and innovative IT-solutions helping your business move to a brand new level. We are ready to provide the whole range of services: from consulting and training of your employees to the development of complex solutions from zero level.</div>-->

        <div>There are many different ways you can use our services – to search for and share information, to communicate with other people or to create new content. When you share information with us, for example by creating a Duck Account, we can make those services even better – to show you more relevant search results and ads, to help you connect with people or to make sharing with others quicker and easier. As you use our services, we want you to be clear how we’re using information and the ways in which you can protect your privacy.

            Our Privacy Policy explains:

            What information we collect and why we collect it.
            How we use that information.
            The choices we offer, including how to access and update information.
            We’ve tried to keep it as simple as possible, but if you’re not familiar with terms like cookies, IP addresses, pixel tags and browsers, then read about these key terms first. Your privacy matters to Duck so whether you are new to Duck or a long-time user, please do take the time to get to know our practices – and if you have any questions contact us.</div>

        <div class="text title">Information we collect</div>

        <div>We collect information to provide better services to all of our users – from figuring out basic stuff like which language you speak, to more complex things like which ads you’ll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which YouTube videos you might like.

            We collect information in the following ways:

            Information you give us. For example, many of our services require you to sign up for a Duck Account. When you do, we’ll ask for personal information, like your name, email address, telephone number or credit card to store with your account. If you want to take full advantage of the sharing features we offer, we might also ask you to create a publicly visible Duck Profile, which may include your name and photo.

            Information we get from your use of our services. We collect information about the services that you use and how you use them, like when you watch a video on YouTube, visit a website that uses our advertising services, or view and interact with our ads and content. This information includes:

            Device information

            We collect device-specific information (such as your hardware model, operating system version, unique device identifiers, and mobile network information including phone number). Duck may associate your device identifiers or phone number with your Duck Account.

            Log information

            When you use our services or view content provided by Duck, we automatically collect and store certain information in server logs. This includes:

            details of how you used our service, such as your search queries.
            telephony log information like your phone number, calling-party number, forwarding numbers, time and date of calls, duration of calls, SMS routing information and types of calls.
            Internet protocol address.
            device event information such as crashes, system activity, hardware settings, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and referral URL.
            cookies that may uniquely identify your browser or your Duck Account.
            Location information

            When you use Duck services, we may collect and process information about your actual location. We use various technologies to determine location, including IP address, GPS, and other sensors that may, for example, provide Duck with information on nearby devices, Wi-Fi access points and cell towers.

            Unique application numbers

            Certain services include a unique application number. This number and information about your installation (for example, the operating system type and application version number) may be sent to Duck when you install or uninstall that service or when that service periodically contacts our servers, such as for automatic updates.

            Local storage

            We may collect and store information (including personal information) locally on your device using mechanisms such as browser web storage (including HTML 5) and application data caches.

            Cookies and similar technologies

            We and our partners use various technologies to collect and store information when you visit a Duck service, and this may include using cookies or similar technologies to identify your browser or device. We also use these technologies to collect and store information when you interact with services we offer to our partners, such as advertising services or Duck features that may appear on other sites. Our Duck Analytics product helps businesses and site owners analyze the traffic to their websites and apps. When used in conjunction with our advertising services, such as those using the DoubleClick cookie, Duck Analytics information is linked, by the Duck Analytics customer or by Duck, using Duck technology, with information about visits to multiple sites.

            Information we collect when you are signed in to Duck, in addition to information we obtain about you from partners, may be associated with your Duck Account. When information is associated with your Duck Account, we treat it as personal information. For more information about how you can access, manage or delete information that is associated with your Duck Account, visit the Transparency and choice section of this policy.</div>
